        For the past two years, I have been a member of the Global Engagement
        Scholars Program. I joined the GESP to learn more about different
        cultures and gain better cultural awareness including a deeper
        understanding of the world. Throughout my journey in the GESP, I have
        developed a wide intercultural understanding through the three different
        components of this program which includes an international academic
        course, co-curricular activities, and an international engagement
        experience. For the academic course component, I learned more in-depth
        about global social science and anthropology. For the co-curricular
        activities segment, I participated in various international events at
        UNC Charlotte. For the international engagement experience, I studied
        abroad in France and Croatia.

        I hope this site can inspire others to consider studying abroad and
        explore other cultures. I believe it is very important to be open-minded
        and accepting of cultural differences.
