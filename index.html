    <p>For the past two years, I have been a member of the Global Engagement Scholars Program. I joined the GESP to learn more about different cultures and gain better cultural awareness including a deeper understanding of the world. 

      Throughout my journey in the GESP, I have developed a wide intercultural understanding through the three different components of this program which includes an international academic course, co-curricular activities, and an international engagement experience. For the academic course component, I learned more in-depth about global social science and anthropology. For the co-curricular activities segment, I participated in various international events at UNC Charlotte. For the international engagement experience, I studied abroad in France and Croatia.</p>
