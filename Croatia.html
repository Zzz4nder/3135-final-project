      <h2>Croatia</h2>
      <p>
        I studied abroad in Dubrovnik, Croatia during spring break in 2024. I
        received credit for the Global Marketing course. After my experience in
        Dubrovnik, I learned the value of collectivism and indirect
        communication.

      <h2>Things I Noticed about Croatia</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Collectivism</h3>
        <p>
          In Croatia, people value collectivism. Croatians are very loyal and
          family-oriented. They show long-term commitment to members of their
          family and extended family. While being in a collectivist culture, I
          learned to be more considerate of others whether it is learning a few
          words in the Croatian language or speaking quietly on buses.

        <h3>Individualism</h3>
        <p>
          In the U.S. culture, people value individualism. Individuals are most
          likely to prioritize themselves over a group. In the United States,
          people focus on personal achievement and happiness.

      <h3>Indirect Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike the U.S. culture, Croatians often favor indirect communication.
        For instance, disagreements may be softened and requests may be phrased
        politely instead of directly stated. Nonverbal cues such as body
        language, facial expressions, and tone of voice carry significant weight
        in communication. After my experience in Croatia, I learned to be
        mindful of nonverbal cues and avoid being overly assertive to adapt to
        their indirect communication culture.
