        <h3>Complete Study Abroad 101</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            This is the first step to study abroad. You must take a free canvas
            course to undertand how to study board and what UNCC offers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Research Your Study Abroad Program</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            After completing 101, students will have a good understanding of the
            different program types, what to consider when selecting a program,
            how academic credit works, and how to search for approved programs
            in the EA’s program database. Students who have already completed
            101 and have identified a program they want to apply for can go to
            step 3 to determine whether or not an appointment with an Advisor is
            required.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Meet with a Education Aborad Advisor</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Meeting with an advisor in EA may be required before a student can
            request access to an application. Refer to the chart below to see
            whether or not a meeting is required, based on the program type
            you’re interested in applying for. If you’re unsure of the program
            type, head back to Study Abroad 101 to learn more.
          </p>
