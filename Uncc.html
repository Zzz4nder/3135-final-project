      <p class="text">
        UNC Charlotte has not only offered me classes that can be challenging,
        but has also provided me with the opportunity to create lifelong friends
        whether through study abroad , activities on campus, or in a classroom.
        Below are some of the co-curricular activities I have been able to
        participate in and grow as an interculturist throughout my journey in
        the GESP.

          The International Festival is a yearly event hosted by UNC Charlotte.
          This festival celebrates diversity, music, and food from over 50
          countries. There are also educational activities, dance performances,
          and much more during the event. After attending this event, I was able
          to learn more about different cultures such as traditional clothing,
          cultural performances, and unfamiliar food. I was able to try a Korean
          dish that I had never tried before and I really enjoyed it! This event
          is very important to the campus and locals because it provides the
          opportunity to participate in different cultural traditions and
          exposure to diversity.
