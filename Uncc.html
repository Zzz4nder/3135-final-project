      <p class="text">
        UNC Charlotte has not only offered me classes that can be challenging,
        but has also provided me with the opportunity to create lifelong friends
        whether through study abroad , activities on campus, or in a classroom.
        Below are some of the co-curricular activities I have been able to
        participate in and grow as an interculturist throughout my journey in
        the GESP.

        <p>
          The International Festival is a yearly event hosted by UNC Charlotte.
          This festival celebrates diversity, music, and food from over 50
          countries. There are also educational activities, dance performances,
          and much more during the event. After attending this event, I was able
          to learn more about different cultures such as traditional clothing,
          cultural performances, and unfamiliar food. I was able to try a Korean
          dish that I had never tried before and I really enjoyed it! This event
          is very important to the campus and locals because it provides the
          opportunity to participate in different cultural traditions and
          exposure to diversity.

        <p>
          This semester I joined the FACE Program and I highly regret not
          participating sooner. This program provides the opportunity for UNC
          Charlotte and international students to meet weekly and participate in
          activities to learn more about one another and build friendships.
          Through this, I made friends from Palestine and India and was able to
          learn more about each other.

        <p>
          International Coffee Hour is an event that takes place on the first
          and third Thursdays of the month. This event provides the opportunity
          for UNC Charlotte and international students to meet, play games, and
          have great conversations. Through this, I was able to build
          cross-cultural friendships and gain more knowledge about different
          cultures from countries such as the Philippines and India.

          The International Festival is held on the UNC Charlotte campus in and
          around the Barnhardt Student Activity Center (SAC). The International
          Festival is centered around booths arranged in colorful marketplace
          style representing the cultures of over 35 nations. The booths are
          staffed by UNC Charlotte international students and members of
          Charlotteâ€™s international community and feature art, crafts and
          costumes from each participating country. Many booths offer
          international food for sale. Festival entry and parking are FREE! The
          International Festival is open to the public. We highly recommend you
          consider bringing cash with you to the event. While some booths may
          accept credit cards, many only accept cash; there are several ATMs on
          campus, but in past years, the lines can be quite long! <br />
          Throughout the day the music and dance of a variety of nations will be
          presented on indoor and outdoor stages. In addition, the International
          Festival, which is family-oriented, offers a number of elements such
          as mimes and face painting designed especially for children.
