      <h1>My Study Abroad Experience</h1>
      <p>
        For my study abroad trip I went to Pairs, France and Dubrovnik, Croatia
        during the 2024 spring break. The trip was around ten days total. Of the
        ten, two consisted of traveling the entire day. For more infomation on
        either city, see below and to see cultural differences click on either
        city name.

          In Paris I spent around four days. Classes started at 11:00 am and
          ended at 4:00 pm so there was a good amount of time to do things in
          the city especially since most places close around 2:00 am. Around the
          popular tourist locations practically all people spoke english
          although the further you get away, from those locations the locals
          tend to only speak french.
        </p>
        <a href="Croatia.html"><h2>Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2></a>
        <p>
          In Dubrovnik I also spent around four days. Dubrovnik is a small
          Coastal city and my trip was during an off season for tourism as the
          Town was cold. For this reason there wasn't as much to do as in Paris.
          Also, many places tended to close earlier than Paris, around 9:00 pm.
          The majority of locals spoke English but less so than in Paris. The
          beauty of the city consisted of the surrounding landscape and the
          architecture.
